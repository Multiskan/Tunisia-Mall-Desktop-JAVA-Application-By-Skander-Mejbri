Tunisia Mall Desktop JAVA Application By Skander Mejbri

The Tunisia Mall mission:
Platform users:
The Mall Administrator is the super user and has complete control over all the activities that can be performed. The application notifies the administrator of all shop creation requests, and the administrator can then approve or reject them. The administrator also manages the list of available product categories. The administrator can also view and delete entries in the guestbook.
Any user can submit a shop creation request through the application. When the request is approved by the Mall Administrator, the requester is notified, and from there on is given the role of Shop Owner. The Shop Owner is responsible for setting up the shop and maintaining it.
The job involves managing the sub-categories of the items in the shop. Also, the shop owner can add or remove items from his shop. The Shop Owner can view different reports that give details of the sales and orders specific to his shop. The Shop Owner can also decide to close shop and remove it from the mall.
A Mall Customer can browse through the shops and choose products to place in a virtual shopping cart. The shopping cart details can be viewed and items can be removed from the cart. To proceed with the purchase, the customer is prompted to login.
Also, the customer can modify personal profile information (such as phone number and shipping address) stored by the application. The customer can also view the status of any previous orders, and cancel any order that has not been shipped yet.

User’s experience:
Several functions will be developed to allow the vendors to manage their own online stores. Functions such as inventory control, show statistics, shop layout, locate a store in the Mall map, virtual visit and payment gateway will be added into this system.
Every shopper can take a look on the store information such as what kind of product this vender is selling.

Due to the highly evolving nature of the project, the following are planned to be delivered if deemed necessary; more payment gateways, dynamic price model by which prices can be changed based on demand and supply and dynamic Storefront: Each customer will have a web page personalized based on his or her recent purchases. This is the equivalent of having a unique storefront for each customer in hopes of drawing in as many return customers as possible .
